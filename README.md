# Eboard_App
Android application that connects to my electric mountainboard via Bluetooth and enables monitoring (and logging) of various parameters (like voltage, current, temperature and so on).

This application was mainly developed as a project during JAVA course, together with Katarzyna Pi√≥rkowska.
